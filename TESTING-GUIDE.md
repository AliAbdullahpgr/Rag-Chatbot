# 🧪 Testing Guide - Local Transformers

## Quick Test: Verify Local Transformers

### Option 1: Test via Browser Console

1. **Start the app**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open browser**: http://localhost:5173

3. **Open DevTools Console** (F12)

4. **Type a question** in the chat and watch console output:
   ```
   🔄 Generating embedding with LOCAL Transformers model...
   📥 Loading all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model locally...
   ✅ Model loaded successfully!
   ✅ Generated 384-dimensional embedding locally
   ```

   **Key signs it's working locally**:
   - ✅ Says "LOCAL Transformers model"
   - ✅ Says "Loading all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model locally"
   - ✅ No fetch requests to huggingface.co API
   - ✅ First query takes 30-60s (downloading model)
   - ✅ Second query takes <1s (cached model)

### Option 2: Test via Node Script

Run the test script:
```bash
node test-local-transformers.js
```

**Expected Output**:
```
🧪 Testing Local Transformers Embedding Generation
============================================================

📝 Test Question: "What laptop does Ali use?"

🔄 Starting embedding generation...
   (First run will download model - takes 30-60 seconds)

🔄 Generating embedding with LOCAL Transformers model...
📥 Loading all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model locally...
✅ Model loaded successfully!
✅ Generated 384-dimensional embedding locally

============================================================
✅ EMBEDDING GENERATION SUCCESSFUL!
============================================================

📊 Results:
   • Dimensions: 384
   • Expected: 384 dimensions
   • Status: ✅ CORRECT
   • Time taken: 32.45s
   • First 5 values: [0.0234, -0.0156, 0.0789, -0.0412, 0.0523...]

🎉 Local Transformers are working correctly!
   No API calls needed - everything runs in your browser!

🔄 Testing second embedding (should be faster)...

🔄 Generating embedding with LOCAL Transformers model...
✅ Generated 384-dimensional embedding locally

✅ Second embedding generated in 0.87s
   Dimensions: 384 (✅ CORRECT)
```

## 🔍 How to Verify It's Running Locally

### Check 1: Network Tab
1. Open DevTools → Network tab
2. Ask a question in the chat
3. **Should NOT see**:
   - ❌ `api-inference.huggingface.co` requests
   - ❌ `POST` to HuggingFace API
4. **Should see**:
   - ✅ `supabase.co` requests (database search only)
   - ✅ `generativelanguage.googleapis.com` (Gemini only)

### Check 2: Browser Cache
1. Open DevTools → Application tab → Cache Storage
2. Look for `transformers-cache`
3. Should see ~90MB of cached model files

### Check 3: Console Logs
Look for these specific messages:
```
✅ "Generating embedding with LOCAL Transformers model"
✅ "Loading all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model locally"
✅ "Model loaded successfully"
```

**NOT** these:
```
❌ "Generating embedding with Hugging Face API"
❌ "HF API error"
```

## ⏱️ Performance Benchmarks

### First Query (Model Download)
- **Embedding**: 30-60 seconds
- **Search**: <1 second
- **AI Response**: 2-3 seconds
- **Total**: ~35 seconds

### Subsequent Queries (Model Cached)
- **Embedding**: <1 second ⚡
- **Search**: <1 second
- **AI Response**: 2-3 seconds
- **Total**: ~4 seconds

## 🎯 Test Questions

Use these to verify the system:

### Question 1: Basic Info
```
"What laptop does Ali use?"
```
**Expected**:
- ✅ Fast embedding generation (after first load)
- ✅ Finds relevant chunks about Dell Latitude
- ✅ Shows source citations

### Question 2: Educational Info
```
"What is Ali studying?"
```
**Expected**:
- ✅ Finds chunks about BSCS 4th year
- ✅ Mentions MNS University

### Question 3: Technical Info
```
"Tell me about Ali's development setup"
```
**Expected**:
- ✅ Multiple relevant chunks
- ✅ Info about Arch Linux, Neovim, etc.

### Question 4: Not in Database
```
"What is Ali's favorite color?"
```
**Expected**:
- ✅ Still generates embedding locally
- ✅ No matching documents
- ✅ Polite "no information" response

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Failed to load model"
**Solution**: Check internet connection (first download only)

### Problem: Takes too long
**Solution**: First load is 30-60s (normal). Subsequent should be <1s.

### Problem: Still seeing API calls
**Solution**: 
1. Clear browser cache
2. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. Check `embeddingUtils.js` has the new code

### Problem: "Module not found"
**Solution**: Run `npm install` to ensure @xenova/transformers is installed
